# Lecture Alg 1 Week 2 Selection Sort
########################################################
#
# ALGORITHM: Ptr which scans from left to right
# INVARIANTS:
#   * Entries left of the Ptr (inc the Ptr) fixed and in ascending order
#   * No entry to the right of Ptr is smaller than any entry to the left of Ptr.
# TO MAINTAIN ALGORITHM INVARIANTS:
#   * Move the pointer to the right: i++
#   * Identify index of minimum entry on right. 03:27 (Loop thru rhs array to get min)
#   * Exchange into position.
# PROPOSITION: 04:38
#   * Selection Sort uses ~ N^2/2 (Quadratic) compares and N (linear) exchanges:
#     N^2/2 =~ (N-1) + (N-2) + ... + 1 + 0
# 05:57 RUNNING TIME INSENSITIVE TO INPUT: Quadratic time, even if input is Sorted.
# 06:12 DATA MOVEMENT IS MIMAL. Linear number of exchanges.
# http://www.Sorting-algorithms.com/selection-Sort 06:39

# 06:52 QUESTION. How many compares does selection sort make when the input
# array is **already sorted**?
# ANSWER: quadratic

# Q: The number of compares to selection sort a reverse-sorted array of N distinct keys is ~1/2 N^2
# A: True. Selection sort uses N(N-1)/2 compares to sort any array of N keys.

# Lecture Alg 1 Week 2 "Sorting Introduction" (14:43)
########################################################

# 04:50 GOAL. Sort any type of data.
#
# Q. How can sort() know how to compare data of type "Double",
# "String", and "java.io.File" without any information about the
# type of an item's key?
#
# CALLBACK = REFERENCE TO EXECUTABLE CODE. (Passing fncs to fncs)
#   * Client passes array of objecys to sort() function.
#   * The "sort()" function calls back object's "compareTo()" method as needed.
#
# IMPLEMENTING CALLBACKS.
#   * java : interfaces
#   * C    : function pointers.
#   * C++  : class-type functors.
#   * C#   : delegates.
#   * Python, Perl, ML, Javascript: first-class functions.
#
# 05:57 COMPARABLE INTERFACE
#
# public interface Comparable<Item>
# {
#   public int compareTo(Item that)
#   {
#     ...
#     return -1; # less than
#     ...
#     return +1; # greater than
#     ...
#     return 0;  # equal to
#   }
# }

# 08:05 TOTAL ORDER
#
# A TOTAL ORDER is a binary relation <= that satisfies:
#   * Antisymmetry: if v<=w and w<=v, then v==w.
#   * Transitivity: if v<=w and w<=x, then v<=x.   v-w-x
#   * Totality: either v<=w or w<=v or both.
#
# Rock-Paper-Scissors is NOT a TOTAL ORDER (intransitivity)

#13:21 TESTING IF SORTED
#
#GOAL. Test if an array is sorted.
#
#Q. If the sorting algorithm passes the test, did it correctly sort the array?
#A. YES. If you used the __lt__ and exchange method.

# 14:36 QUESTION: Consider the data type "Temp" defined below. Which
# of the following required properties of the "Comparble" interface
# does the compareTo() method violate?
#
# public class Temp implements Comparable<Temp> {
#   private final double deg;
#
#   public Temp(double deg) {
#     this.deg = deg;
#   }
#
#   public int compareTo(Temp that) {
#     double EPS = 0.1;
#     if (this.deg < that.deg - EPS)
#       return -1;
#     if (this.deg > that.deg + EPS)
#       return +1;
#     return 0;
#   }
#
#       deg-EPS    deg    deg+EPS
#             <     |     >
#
#       v     <   |   >
#       x    <   |   >
#       w           <   |   >
#          ------>v w<------------- v<=w
#          ->x          w<---------
#               000000000011111111112222222222
#               012345678901234567890123456789
#                     <         a         >
#            <          b         >
#	     <        c         >
# ---------->b                  a<---------- a>b
# ---->c                b<------------------ b>c => a>b>c => a>c
# ---->c                        a<---------- a:w
#
# ANSWER: Transitivity
# EXPLANATION: Transitivity is violated.
# YOU MUST NOT INTRODUCE A FUDGE FACTOR WHEN COMPARING TWO
# FLOATING_POINT NUMBERS IF YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT THE Comparable INTERFACE.

# QUESTION: An exchange in selection sort can decrease the nubmer of
# inversions by two (or more)
# ANSWER: True. Consider the array {3, 2, 1}, which has 3 inversions.
# The first exchange results in the array {1, 2, 3}, which has 0 inversions.

# QUESTION: Let a[] be an array containing N distinct keys with N >= 4.
# Then, exchanging two items can decrease the number of inversions by strictly more than N.
# Answer: True. Consider the array { N, 2, 3, 4, ..., 1 }, which has 2N-3 inversions.
# Exchanging N and 1 results in the array { 1, 2, 3, ..., N }, which has zero inversions.

### Stability (Week 3 Lecture "Stability")
########################################################
#
#-------------------------------------------------------
# 03:42 PROPOSITION: Selection Sort IS NOT stable.
#
# NOTE ON TABLE BELOW: Items depicted as A1 and A2 in the example
# below have the same key, "A".  The 1 and 2 following the "A"
# are denote that A1 was 1st and A2 was 2nd.
#
# PROOF BY COUNTEREXAMPLE: Long distance exchange might move
# an item past some equal item.
#
#
# NOTE: if "__lt__" in the "Sort" routine were "less than or equal to",
# it would not work.
#
# i min 0  1   2
# ----------------
# 0 2 *B1 *B2 >A   > Choose min(A), exch(B1,A), B1 moved past equal B2
# 1 1  A  >B2 *B1
# 2 2  A   B2 >B1
#     *A  *A2 *A3
#

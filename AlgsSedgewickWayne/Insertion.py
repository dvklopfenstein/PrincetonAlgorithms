# SIMULATION: 00:32 to 02:40
#
# ALGORITHM: Ptr scans from Left to Right
# INVARIANTS: 02:50
#   * Entries to the left or Ptr (inc Ptr) are in ascending order
#   * Entries to the right of Ptr have not yet been seen
# PROPOSITION: 04:27 To sort a randomly-ordered array with distinct keys:
#   ~ 1/4*N^2 compares  on average
#   ~ 1/4*N^2 exchanges on average
# PROOF: 05:16 Expect each entry to move halfway back below the diagonal on the average
#
# INSERTION SORT: BEST CASE AND WORST CASE: 06:10
# BEST CASE 06:12: If the array is in ascending order,
#   insertion sort makes N-1 compares and 0 exchanges
#   A E E L , O P R S T X
# WORST CASE 06:37: If the array is in descending order (and no duplicates),
#   insertion sort makes:
#       ~ 1/2*N^2 compares and
#       ~ 1/2*N^2 exchanges (Slower that Selection sort)
#   X T S R P O M L E E A
#   For every step, it is not just comparing, it is also exchanging
#
# MEMORY: Insertion sort uses only a constant amount of memory (other than the input array).
# This is a key property of insertion sort.
#
# INSERTION SORT: PARTIALLY-SORTED ARRAYS 07:47 - 08:20
#   Appear often in practice:
#     1. All elems sorted except a few unsorted elements appended at the end
#     2. Just a few elems out of place.
# DEFINITION: An INVERSION is a pair of keys that are out of order:
#   A E E L M O T R X P S (6 inversions: T-R T-P T-S R-P X-P X-S)
# DEFINITION: An array is PARTIALLY-SORTED if the number of inversions is <= c*N
#  * Ex 1. A subarray of size 10 appended to a sorted subarray of size N
#  * Ex 2. An array of size N with only 10 entries out of place
#
# PROPOSITION: For partially-sorted arrays, insertion sort runs in linear time. 08:57
# PROOF: Number of exchanges equals the numbers of inversions
#   number of compares = exchanges + (N - 1)
#
# INSERTION SORT IS INEFFICIENT because elements only move one place at a time
# even if we know that they have to move far away.
#
# QUESTION: How many compares does insertion sort make on an imput array that is already sorted?
# ANSWER: linear
#
# QUESTION: True or False? The expected # of compares to insertion sort an array
# containing N/2 0s and N/2 1s in uniformly random order is ~1/4 N^2.
# ANSWER: False.
# Consider element i>0. How many of the items a[0], a[1], ..., a[i-1] is a[i] inverted with?
# If a[i] == 1 (which happens with probability 1/2), then the number is 0.
# If a[i] == 0 (which happens with probability 1/2), then we expect half of the i previous
# elements to be 1s, so the expected number is i/2.
# So the expected number of inversions is:
#     1/2(0/2 + 1/2 + 2/2 + 3/2 + ... + (N-1)/2) ~N^2/8.
# Thus, the expected number of compares is ~ 1/8 N^2

# TRUE: Any pair of items is compared no more than once during insertion sort.
# EXPLANATION: Let a[i] and a[j] be two entries in the unsorted array with i<j.
# The entries a[i] and a[j] are compred no more than once during iteration j and they are not
# compared during any other iteration.

# When I actually run these and get a count of compares, I get a different
# number of compares than what the answer says, but here is 'the answer':
#
# Seed: 962938
# QUESTION: The number of compares to insertion sort an array of the form

# ANSWER: False. The number of inversions is 0 + 1 + ... + N/2 - 1 ~ 1/8 N^2.
# Thus, the number of compares is ~ 1/8 N^2.
# MY ANSWER: 19 compares on an actual run. 1/8 N^2=100/8=12.5 Anyone know why?
#
# QUESTION: The number of compares to insertion sort an array of N/2 1s
# interleaved with N/2 0s (e.g., 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0) is ~ 1/8 N^2.
# ANSWER: True. The number of inversions is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N/2 ~ 1/8 N^2.
# Thus, the number of compares is ~ 1/8 N^2.
# MY ANSWER: 23 compares on an actual run. 1/8 N^2=100/8=12.5 Anyone know why?

# QUESTION: The number of compares to insertion sort an array of N/2 1s
# followed by N/2 0s (e.g., 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0) is ~ 1/2 N^2.
# ANSWER: False. The number of inversions is (N/2)*(N/2) = 1/4 N^2.
# Thus, the number of compares is ~ 1/4 N^2.
# MY ANSWER: 33 compares on an actual run.

# QUESTION: The number of compares to insertion sort an array of N/2 keys
# in strictly increasing order followed by the same N/2 keys in strictly
# decreasing order (e.g., 0 1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 0) is ~1/4 N^2.
# ANSWER: The number of inversions is 0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + (N-2) ~ 1/4 N^2.
# Thus, the number of compares is ~ 1/4 N^2.
# MY ANSWER: 29 compares on an actual run.

#
# PROOF: Equal items never move past each other (in the "Sort" code)
#
# NOTE: Items depicted as A1 and A2 in the example below have the same
# key, "A".  The 1 and 2 following the "A" are denote that A1 was 1st
# and A2 was 2nd.
#
# NOTE: if "__lt__" in the "Sort" routine were "less than or equal to",
# it would not work.

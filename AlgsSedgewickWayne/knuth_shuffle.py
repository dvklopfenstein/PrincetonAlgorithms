# Note on Python random: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
#   * random.randint(a, b) Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b.
#   * Alias for randrange(a, b+1).

# 00:11 SHUFFLE SORT: An easy application of sorting to a related problem, called shuffling
# * Generate a random real number for each array entry
#   (Useful for shuffling columns in a spreadsheet)
# * Sort the array
#
# An effective way to shuffle an array is to generate a random number
# for each entry in the array.  Then sort the array using the random
# numbers as the key.
#
# PROPOSITION: Shuffle sort produces a uniformly random premutation
# of the input array, provided no duplicate values.
# (assuming real numbers uniformly at random)
# Well shuffled:  Every possible way of shuffling the deck appears with equal probability
#
# DRAWBACK: Need to pay cost of full sort?  NO, WE DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THAT COST...

# 01:32 KNUTH SHUFFLE DEMO: (Linear time shuffling algorithm)
# * In iteration i, pick integer r between 0 and i uniformly at random.
# * Swap a[i] and a[r]
#
# 03:31 PROPOSITION: [Fisher-Yates 1938] Knuth shuffling algorithm produces a
# uniformly random permutation of the input array in linear time.
# (Assuming integers uniformly chosen at random)

# KNUTH SHUFFLE
# * In iteration i, pick integer r between 0 and i uniformly at random.
#   Common bug: between 0 and N-1 (Does NOT give a uniformly random result)
#   Correct:    between i and N-1
# * Swap a[i] and a[r]

#   for i := 1 to 52 do begin
#     r := random(51) + 1; # BUG: between 1 and 51
#     swap := card[r];
#     card[r] := card[i];
#     card[i] := swap;
#   end;
#
# BUG 1: Random number r never 52 => 52nd card can't end up in 52nd place.
# BUG 2: Shuffle not uniform (because choosing between 0 and N-1 instead of
#        between i and N-1.
# BUG 3: random() uses 32-bit seed => 2^32 possible shuffles (not enough)
# BUG 4: Seed = ms since midnight => Only 86.4 million shuffles
#
# EXPLOIT: After seeing 5 cards and synchronizing with server clock,
# can determine **all** future cards in real time!!

# 07:05 BEST PRACTICES FOR SHUFFLING (IF YOUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON IT).
# * Use a hardware random-number generator that has passed both
#   the FIPS 140-2 and the NIST statistical test suites.
# * Continously monitor statistical properties:
#   hardware random-number generators are fragile and fail silently
# * Use an unbiased shuffling algorithm.
#

# QUESTION: How many possible permuations are there in a deck of 52 playing cards?
# ANSWER:   52!

# 00:18 QUICK-FIND [eager approach]
#
# Data Structure
# * Integer array id[] of size N
# * Interpretation: p and 1 are connected iff they have the same id:
#
#      0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9    0, 5 and 6 are connected
# id[] 0  1  1  8  8  0  0  1  8  8    1, 2 and 7 are connected
#                                      3, 4, 8 and 9 are connected
#   0  1--2  3--4
#   |     |  |  |
#   5--6  7  8  9
#
# 01:51
# FIND: Check if p and qval have the same id.
#
# UNION: To merge components containing p and qval, change all
#        entries whose id equals id[p] to id[qval]
#
# union(6, 1):
#           0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
# WAS: id[] 0  1  1  8  8  0  0  1  8  8
# NOW: id[] 1  1  1  8  8  1  1  1  8  8
#           X  .  .  .  .  X  X  .  .  .
#
# THis is a problem when we have a huge number of objects
# because we have a lot of values to change.  But it is
# easy to implement.

# 07:05
# COST MODEL.	Number of array accesses (for read or write)
# Order of growth of number of array accesses
#
#            init union find
# quick-find    N    N    1
#
# QUICK-FIND DEFECT: Union too expensive
#
# EX. N union commands on N objects takes N^2 (Quadratic)
# array accesses to process the sequence of N objects.

# 08:17 AS COMPUTERS GET FASTER AND BIGGER, QUADRATIC ALGORITHMS GET SLOWER.
#
# Today people have computers that can run billions of operations per second
# and they have billions of entries in main memory.
# => Can touch everything in main memory in about a second
# True for the last 50-60 years; Computers get bigger, but they get faster
# True then when computers had a few thousand words of memory
# True now  when computers have millions or more

# 09:47 QUADRATCIC ALGORITHMS DO NOT SCALE
#
# ROUGH STANDARD (FOR NOW).
# * 10^9 operations per second.
# * 10^9 words of main memory.
# * Touch all words in approximately 1 second (a truism since 1950!)
#
# EX. HUGE PROBLEM FOR QUICK-FIND
# * 10^9 union commands on 10^9 objects
# * Quick-find takes more tha 10^18 operations.
# * 30+ years of computer time!
#
# Ex: Takes N^2 accesses to process sequence of N union commands on N objects.
# 10:13 QUADRATIC ALGORITHMS ARE UNEXCEPTABLY SLOW AND DO NOT SCALE WITH TECHNOLOGY: 08:50
#   * New computer may be 10x as fast
#   * But, has 10x as much memory =>
#     want to solve a problem that is 10x as big.
#   * With quadratic algorithm, takes 10x as long!!

# QUESTION: The maximum number of ID[] array entries that can change (from one
# integer to a # different integer) during one call to union when using the
# quick-find data structure on N elements?
# ANSWER: N - 1
# EXPLANATION: In the worst case, all of the entries except id[qval] are
# changed from id[p] to id[qval]

Question 1
Social network connectivity. Given a social network
containing N members and a log file containing M timestamps
at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design
an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all
members are connected (i.e., every member is a friend of a
friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log
file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an
equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm
should be MlogN or better and use extra space proportional
to N.

Question Explanation: Hint: union-find.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2
Union-find with specific canonical element. Add a method
find() to the union-find data type so that find(i) returns
the largest element in the connected component containing i.
The operations, union(), connected(), and find() should all
take logarithmic time or better.

For example, if one of the connected components is
{1,2,6,9}, then the find() method should return 9 for each
of the four elements in the connected components.

Question Explanation
Hint: maintain an extra array to the weighted quick-union
data structure that stores for each root i the large element
in the connected component containing i.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3
Successor with delete. Given a set of N integers
S={0,1,...,N−1} and a sequence of requests of the following
form:
  * Remove x from S
  * Find the successor of x: the smallest y in S such that y≥x.
design a data type so that all operations (except
construction) should take logarithmic time or better.

Question Explanation
Hint: use the modification of the union-find data discussed
in the previous question.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4
Union-by-size. Develop a union-find implementation that uses
the same basic strategy as weighted quick-union but keeps
track of tree height and always links the shorter tree to
the taller one. Prove a lgN upper bound on the height of the
trees for N sites with your algorithm.

Question Explanation
Hint: replace the sz[] array with a ht[] array such that
ht[i] stores the height of the subtree rooted at i.

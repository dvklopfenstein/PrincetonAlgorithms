<center><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></center>
</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p><b> Can I use different class names, method names,
or method signatures from those prescribed in the API?</b>
No, as usual, your assignment will not be graded if it violates the API.


</p><p><b> Is 0 a block?</b>
No, 0 represents the blank square. Do not treat it as a block when computing either
the Hamming or Manhattan priority functions.

</p><p><b> Can I assume that the puzzle inputs (arguments to the Board constructor and input to Solver)
are valid?</b>
Yes, though it never hurts to include some basic error checking.

</p><p><b>Do I have to implement my own stack, queue, and priority queue?</b>
You must use either <tt>MinPQ</tt> or <tt>MaxPQ</tt> for your priority queue (because we will intercept calls in
order to do performance analysis).
For the other data types, you may use versions from either <tt>algs4.jar</tt> or <tt>java.util</tt>.


</p><p><b>How do I return an <tt>Iterable&lt;Board&gt;</tt>?</b>
Add the items you want to a <tt>Stack&lt;Board&gt;</tt>
or <tt>Queue&lt;Board&gt;</tt> and return that.

</p><p><b>How do I implement <tt>equals()</tt>?</b>
Java has some arcane rules for implementing <tt>equals()</tt>,
discussed on p. 103 of Algorithms, 4th edition.
Note that the argument to <tt>equals()</tt> is required to be <tt>Object</tt>.
You can also inspect
<a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/12oop/Date.java.html">Date.java</a>
or
<a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/12oop/Transaction.java.html">Transaction.java</a>
for online examples.


</p><p><b>Must I implement the <tt>toString()</tt> method for <tt>Board</tt> exactly as specified?</b>
Yes. Be sure to include the board dimension and use 0 for the blank square.
Use <tt>String.format()</tt> to format strings—it works like <tt>StdOut.printf()</tt>, but
returns the string instead of printing it to standard output.
For reference, our implementation is below, but yours may vary depending on your choice of
instance variables.

</p><blockquote>
<pre>public String toString() {
    StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder();
    s.append(N + "\n");
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++) {
            s.append(String.format("%2d ", tiles[i][j]));
        }
        s.append("\n");
    }
    return s.toString();
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<!--
<p><b>How should I implement the <tt>draw()</tt> method in <tt>Board</tt>?</b>
It is intended primarily for debugging. You should draw a graphical representation of
the board, similar to the output of the <tt>toString()</tt> method. You can
use <tt>StdDraw.text(x, y, s)</tt> (where <tt>s</tt> is a string that does not contain newlines) to draw the string <tt>s</tt>, centered on
(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>). You can also use
<tt>StdDraw.setFont(new Font("SansSerif", Font.PLAIN, 24));</tt> to change 
the font size.
-->

<p><b>Should the <tt>hamming()</tt> and <tt>manhattan()</tt> methods
in <tt>Board</tt> return the Hamming and Manhattan priority functions, respectively?</b>
No, <tt>hamming()</tt> should return the number of blocks out of position and 
<tt>manhattan()</tt> should return the sum of the Manhattan distances between
the blocks and their goal positions. Recall that the blank square is not considered a block.
You will compute the priority function
in <tt>Solver</tt> by calling <tt>hamming()</tt> or <tt>manhattan()</tt>
and adding to it the number of moves.

</p><p><b>I'm a bit confused about the purpose of the twin() method.</b>
You will use it to determine whether a puzzle is solvable: exactly one of
a board and its twin are solvable. A twin is obtained by swapping two adjacent blocks (the blank
does not count) in the same row. For example, here is a board and its 5 possible 
twins. Your solver will use only one twin.

<p><b> How do I reconstruct the solution once I've dequeued
the goal search node?</b>
Since each search node records the previous search node to get there,
you can chase the pointers all the way back to the initial
search node (and consider them in reverse order).

</p><p><b> Can I terminate the search as soon as a goal search node is enqueued
(instead of dequeued)?</b>
No, even though it does lead to a correct solution for the slider
puzzle problem using the Hamming and Manhattan priority functions,
it's not techincally the A* algorithm (and will not find the correct solution
for other problems and other priority functions).
<!--
Here’s a simple argument that checking the search node
when it is enqueued (instead of dequeued) 
is correct here; moreover, it is (nearly) a correct implementation of the A* algorithm here. 
When a goal search node s* is enqueued, it is because a neighboring search node s
is one move away from 
the solution. Assume this neighbor s has hamming (or manhattan) priority k. Since it is one 
move away, its hamming (or manhattan) distance is 1, so the number of moves to get there is 
k-1. The goal search node s* has exactly the same priority k: its hamming (or manhattan) distance is 
0 and its number of moves is k. Thus, if we enqueue s*, the A* algorithm can dequeue s* next 
(and terminate) because s* has the minimum priority k. I guess, technically, the other 
neighbors of s should be enqueued, but these will have higher priorities and not be relevant. 
-->

</p><p><b> I noticed that the priorities of the search nodes
dequeued from the priority queue
never decrease. Is this a property of the A* algorithm?</b>
Yes.
In the language of the A* algorithm, the Hamming and Manhattan distances (before
adding in the number of moves so far) are known as <em>heuristics</em>. If
a heuristic is both <em>admissible</em> (never overestimates the number of moves to
the goal search node) and <em>consistent</em> (satisfies a certain triangle inequality),
then this noticed property is guaranteed. 
The Hamming and Manhattan heuristics are both admissible and consistent.
You may use this noticed property as a debugging clue: if the priority of the search node dequeued 
from the priority queue decreases, then you know you did something wrong.

</p><p><b>Even with the critical optimization, the priority queue may contain two or more search nodes
corresponding to the same board. Should I try to eliminate these?</b>
In principle, you could do so with a set data type such as <tt>SET</tt> in <tt>algs4.jar</tt> or
<tt>java.util.TreeSet</tt> or <tt>java.util.HashSet</tt>
(provided that the <tt>Board</tt> data type were either <tt>Comparable</tt> or had a <tt>hashCode()</tt>
method).
However, almost all of the benefit from avoiding duplicate boards is already
extracted from the critical optimization and the cost of identifying other duplicate 
boards will be more than the remaining benefit from doing so.

</p><p><b>Can I put the logic for detecting whether a puzzle is infeasible in
Board instead of Solver?</b>
There is a elegant algorithm for determining whether a board is solvable that relies on a
parity argument (and occasionally we change our API to require this solution).
However, the current API requires you to detect infeasiblity
in <tt>Solver</tt> by using two synchronized A* searches (e.g., using two priority queues).

</p><p><b>I run out of memory when running some of the large sample puzzles. What should I do?</b>
Be sure to ask Java for additional memory,
e.g., <tt>java -Xmx1600m Solver puzzle36.txt</tt>.
We recommend running from the command line (and not from the DrJava interaction pane).
You should expect to run out of memory when using the Hamming priority function.
Be sure not to put the JVM option in the wrong spot or it will be
treated as a command-line argument, 
e.g., <tt>java Solver -Xmx1600m puzzle36.txt</tt>.


</p><p><b>My program can't solve puzzle4x4-hard1.txt or puzzle4x4-hard2.txt,
even if I give it a huge amount of space. What am I doing wrong?</b>
Probably nothing. The A* algorithm will struggle to solve even some 4-by-4 instances.

There were a total of 10 search nodes enqueued and 5 search nodes dequeued.
In general, the number of search nodes enqueued and dequeued may vary slightly, depending
the order in which the search nodes with equal priorities come off the priority queue,
which depends on the order in which <tt>neighbors()</tt>
returns the neighbors of a board. However, for this input, there are no such ties,
so you should have exactly 10 search nodes enqueued and 5 search nodes dequeued.


<p></p></li><li>
The contents of our priority queue (sorted by priority)
just before dequeueing each node when using the Hamming priority function on <tt>puzzle04.txt</tt> 
turns out to be identical to the results above: for this input file, throughout the A* algorithm,
a block is never more than one position away from its goal position, which implies that the
Hamming function and the Manhattan functions are equal.

<p>

These are purely suggestions for how you might make progress.  You do
not have to follow these steps.

<ul>

<p><li> Be sure that you understand the relevant terminology, including
<em>board</em>, <em>block</em>, <em>search node</em>, <em>Hamming distance</em>,
<em>Manhattan distance</em>, <em>Hamming priority function</em>,
<em>Manhattan priority function</em>, and <em>twin board</em>.


<p><li> Write the data type <tt>Board</tt> that represents
an <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em> puzzle board.
Be sure to throughly test and debug it before proceding.

<p><li> Write a nested class <tt>SearchNode</tt> that represents a search node
of the game (board, number of moves to reach it, and previous search node).
Make it implement the <tt>Comparable&lt;SearchNode&gt;</tt> interface
so that you can use it with a <tt>MinPQ</tt>. 
The <tt>compareTo()</tt> method should compare search nodes based on their
Hamming or Manhattan priorities.
<!-- 
You can either
make this a nested class within <tt>Solver</tt> or make it a 
stand-alone class.
-->

<p></p><li> Write the class <tt>Solver</tt> that uses the A*
algorithm to solve puzzle instances.

</p><p>

</p><p><b>How can I reduce the amount of memory a <tt>Board</tt> uses?</b>
For starters, recall that an N-by-N <tt>int[][]</tt> array in Java uses
about 24 + 32N + 4N^2 bytes; when N equals 3, this is 156 bytes.
To save memory, consider using an <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em> <tt>char[][]</tt> array
or a length <em>N</em>^2 <tt>char[]</tt> array.
In principle, each board is a permutation of size N^2, so you need only about lg ((N^2)!)
bits to represent it; when N equals 3, this is only 19 bits.

</p><p><b>Any ways to speed up the algorithm?</b>
Yes there are many opportunities for optimization here.
</p><ul>
<p></p><li> Use a 1d array instead of a 2d array (as suggested above).

<p></p></li><li> Cache either the Manhattan distance of a board (or Manhattan 
priority of a search node). It is waste to recompute the same quantity over
and over again.

<p></p></li><li> Exploit the fact that the difference in Manhattan distance 
between a board and a neighbor is either +1, -1, or 0, based on the
direction that the block moves.

<p></p></li><li> Use only one PQ to run the A* algorithm on the initial board
and its twin.

<p></p></li><li> When two search nodes have the same Manhattan priority,
you can break ties however you want, e.g., by comparing either 
the Hamming or Manhattan distances of the two boards.

<p></p></li><li> Use a parity argument to determine whether a puzzle is
unsolvable (instead of two synchronous A* searches). However,
this will either break the API or will require a fragile dependence
on the <tt>toString()</tt> method, so don't do it.

</li></ul>

<p><b>Is there an efficient way to solve the 8-puzzle and its generalizations?</b>
Finding a shortest solution to an <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em> slider puzzle is
<a href="http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1986/aaai86-027.php">NP-hard</a>,
so it's unlikely that an efficient solution exists.

</p><p><b>What if I'm satisfied with any solution and don't need one 
that uses the fewest number of moves?</b>
Yes, change the priority function to put more weight on the
Manhattan distance, e.g., 100 times the Manhattan distance plus
the number of moves made already.
<a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/~ccalabro/essays/15_puzzle.pdf">This paper</a>
describes an algorithm that guarantees to perform at most N^3 moves.

</p><p><b>Are ther better ways to solve 8- and 15-puzzle instances using
the minimum number of moves?</b>
Yes, there are a number of approaches.

</p><ul>
<p></p><li> Use the A* algorithm with a better admissible priority function:
<ul>

<p></p><li>
<em>Linear conflict</em>: add two to the Manhattan priority function whenever
two tiles are in their goal row (or column) but are reversed relative to
their goal position.

<p></p></li><li>
<em>Pattern database</em>: For each possible
configuration of 4 tiles and the blank, determine the minimum number of
moves to put just these tiles in their proper position and store these
values in a database. The heuristic value is the maximum over all configurations,
plus the number of moves made so far.
This can reduce the number of search nodes examined for random 15-puzzle instances
by a factor of 1000. 
</li></ul>

<p></p></li><li> Use a variant of the A* algorithm known as 
IDA* (for iterative deepening).
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.56.6688">This paper</a>
describes its application to the 15-slider puzzle.

<p></p></li><li>
Another approach
is to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_search">bidirectional
search</a>, where you simultaneously search from the initial board to find the goal board
and from the goal board to find the initial board, and have the two search trees meet 
in the middle. Handling the stopping condition is delicate.
</li></ul>


<p><b>Can a puzzle have more than one shortest solution?</b>
Yes. See <tt>puzzle07.txt</tt>.

In such cases, you are required to output any one such solution.

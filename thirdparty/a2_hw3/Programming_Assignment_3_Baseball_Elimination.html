<h2>Programming Assignment 3: Baseball Elimination</h2>

<p>
Given the standings in a sports division at some point during the season,
determine which teams have been mathematically eliminated from
winning their division.

</p><p>
<strong>The baseball elimination problem.</strong>
&nbsp;
In the
<a href="http://riot.ieor.berkeley.edu/~baseball/">baseball elimination problem</a>,
there is a division consisting of <em>N</em> teams.
At some point during the season, team <em>i</em> has
<tt>w[i]</tt> wins, <tt>l[i]</tt> losses, <tt>r[i]</tt> remaining games,
and <tt>g[i][j]</tt> games left to play against team <em>j</em>.
A team is mathematically eliminated if it cannot possibly finish the
season in (or tied for) first place.
The goal is to determine exactly which teams are mathematically eliminated.
For simplicity, we assume that no games end in a tie (as is the case in Major League Baseball)
and that there are no rainouts (i.e., every scheduled game is played).

</p><p>
The problem is not as easy as many sports writers would have you
believe, in part because the answer depends not only on the
number of games won and left to play, but also on the
schedule of remaining games. To see the complication,
consider the following scenario:

</p><p>
</p><blockquote><pre> 
                w[i] l[i] r[i]        g[i][j]
i  team         wins loss left   Atl Phi NY  Mon
------------------------------------------------
0  Atlanta       83   71    8     -   1   6   1
1  Philadelphia  80   79    3     1   -   0   2
2  New York      78   78    6     6   0   -   0
3  Montreal      77   82    3     1   2   0   -
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Montreal is mathematically
eliminated since it can finish with at most 80 wins and
Atlanta already has 83 wins. This is the simplest reason
for elimination. However, there can be more complicated
reasons. For example, Philadelphia is also mathematically
eliminated. It can finish the season with as many as 83 wins,
which appears to be enough to tie Atlanta. But this would
require Atlanta to lose all of its remaining games, including
the 6 against New York, in which 
case New York would finish with 84 wins.
We note that New York is not yet mathematically eliminated
despite the fact that it has fewer wins than Philadelphia.

</p><p>
It is sometimes not so easy for a sports writer to explain why
a particular team is mathematically eliminated.
Consider the following scenario from the
American League East on August 30, 1996:


</p><p>
</p><blockquote><pre>
                w[i] l[i] r[i]          g[i][j]
i  team         wins loss left   NY Bal Bos Tor Det
---------------------------------------------------
0  New York      75   59   28     -   3   8   7   3
1  Baltimore     71   63   28     3   -   2   7   7
2  Boston        69   66   27     8   2   -   0   3
3  Toronto       63   72   27     7   7   0   -   3
4  Detroit       49   86   27     3   7   3   3   -
</pre></blockquote>
<p>

It might appear that Detroit has a remote chance
of catching New York and winning
the division because Detroit can finish with as many as 76 wins if
they go on a 27-game winning steak, which
is one more than New York would have if they go on a 28-game losing streak.
Try to convince yourself that Detroit is already mathematically eliminated.
Here's one <a href="http://riot.ieor.berkeley.edu/~baseball/detroit.html">
ad hoc explanation</a>; we will present a simpler explanation below.


</p><p>
<strong>A maxflow formulation.</strong>
&nbsp;
We now solve the baseball elimination problem by reducing it to the
maxflow problem. To check whether 
team <em>x</em> is eliminated, we consider two cases.

</p><ul>
<p></p><li><em>Trivial elimination.</em>
If the maximum number of games team <em>x</em> can win is less than
the number of wins of some other team <em>i</em>, then
team <em>x</em> is trivially eliminated (as is Montreal in the example above).
That is, if <tt>w[x]</tt> + <tt>r[x]</tt> &lt; <tt>w[i]</tt>, then
team <em>x</em> is mathematically eliminated.

<p></p></li><li><em>Nontrivial elimination.</em>
Otherwise, we create a flow network and solve a maxflow problem in it.
In the network, feasible integral
flows correspond to outcomes of the remaining schedule.
There are vertices corresponding to teams (other than team <em>x</em>) and to
remaining divisional games (not involving team <em>x</em>).
Intuitively, each unit of flow in the network corresponds to a remaining 
game. As it flows through the network from <em>s</em> to <em>t</em>,
it passes from a game vertex,
say between teams <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>, then through one of the
team vertices <em>i</em> or <em>j</em>, classifying this game as
being won by that team.

<p>

More precisely, the flow network includes the following edges and capacities.
</p><ul>
<p></p><li>
We connect an artificial source vertex <em>s</em> to
each game vertex <em>i</em>-<em>j</em> and set its capacity to <tt>g[i][j]</tt>.
If a flow uses all <tt>g[i][j]</tt> units of capacity on this edge,
then we interpret this as playing all of these games, with the wins distributed
between the team vertices <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>.

<p></p></li><li>
We connect each game vertex <em>i</em>-<em>j</em> with the two
opposing team vertices to ensure that one of the two teams earns a win.
We do not need to restrict the amount of flow on such edges.

<p></p></li><li>
Finally, we connect each team vertex to an artificial sink vertex <em>t</em>.
We want to know if there is some way of completing all the games so that team 
<em>x</em> ends up winning at least as many games as team <em>i</em>. Since
team <em>x</em> can win as many as <tt>w[x] + r[x]</tt> games, we prevent
team <em>i</em> from winning more than that many games in total, by 
including an edge from team vertex <em>i</em> to the 
sink vertex with capacity <tt>w[x] + r[x] - w[i]</tt>.
</li></ul>

<p>
If all edges in the maxflow that are pointing from <em>s</em> are full,
then this corresponds to assigning winners to all of
the remaining games in such a way that no team wins more games than <em>x</em>.
If some edges pointing from <em>s</em> are not full,
then there is no scenario in which team <em>x</em> can win the division.
In the flow network below Detroit is team <em>x = 4</em>.

<strong>What the min cut tells us.</strong>
&nbsp;
By solving a maxflow problem, we can determine whether a given team
is mathematically eliminated. We would also like to 
<em>explain</em> the reason for the team's elimination to a friend 
in nontechnical terms (using only grade-school arithmetic).
Here's such an explanation for Detroit's
elimination in the American League East example above.
With the best possible luck, Detroit finishes the season with
49 + 27 = 76 wins.
Consider the subset of teams <em>R</em> = { New York, Baltimore, Boston, Toronto }.
Collectively, they already have 75 + 71 + 69 + 63 = 278 wins; there are also 
3 + 8 + 7 + 2 + 7  = 27 remaining games among them, so these four teams
must win at least an additional 27 games.
Thus, on average, the teams in <em>R</em> win at least 305 / 4 = 76.25 games.
Regardless of the outcome, one team in <em>R</em> will win at least
77 games, thereby eliminating Detroit.

</p></li></ul>
<p>

In fact, when a team is mathematically eliminated
there always exists such a convincing
<em>certificate of elimination</em>,
where <em>R</em> is some subset of the other teams in the division.
Moreover, you can always find such a subset <em>R</em> by choosing the
team vertices on the source side of a min <em>s</em>-<em>t</em> cut in the 
baseball elimination network.
Note that although we solved a maxflow/mincut problem to find the subset <em>R</em>,
once we have it, the argument for a team's elimination involves only grade-school algebra.

</p><p>
<strong>Your assignment.</strong>
&nbsp;
Write an immutable data type <tt>BaseballElimination</tt> that represents a sports division and determines
which teams are mathematically eliminated by implementing the following API:

</p><blockquote>
<pre><b>public BaseballElimination(String filename)                    </b><font color="gray">// create a baseball division from given filename in format specified below</font>
<b>public              int numberOfTeams()                        </b><font color="gray">// number of teams</font>
<b>public Iterable&lt;String&gt; teams()                                </b><font color="gray">// all teams</font>
<b>public              int wins(String team)                      </b><font color="gray">// number of wins for given team</font>
<b>public              int losses(String team)                    </b><font color="gray">// number of losses for given team</font>
<b>public              int remaining(String team)                 </b><font color="gray">// number of remaining games for given team</font>
<b>public              int against(String team1, String team2)    </b><font color="gray">// number of remaining games between team1 and team2</font>
<b>public          boolean isEliminated(String team)              </b><font color="gray">// is given team eliminated?</font>
<b>public Iterable&lt;String&gt; certificateOfElimination(String team)  </b><font color="gray">// subset R of teams that eliminates given team; null if not eliminated</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
The last six methods should throw a <tt>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException</tt>
if one (or both) of the input arguments are invalid teams.


</p><p>
<strong>Input format.</strong>
&nbsp;
The input format is the number of teams in the division <em>N</em> followed by one line for each team.
Each line contains the team name (with no internal whitespace characters), the number of wins, the number
of losses, the number of remaining games, and the number of remaining games against each
team in the division.

For example, the input files
<a href="http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/baseball/teams4.txt">teams4.txt</a>
and
<a href="http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/baseball/teams5.txt">teams5.txt</a>
correspond to the two examples discussed above.

</p><p>
</p><blockquote><pre>% <b>more teams4.txt</b>
4
Atlanta       83 71  8  0 1 6 1
Philadelphia  80 79  3  1 0 0 2
New_York      78 78  6  6 0 0 0
Montreal      77 82  3  1 2 0 0

% <b>more teams5.txt</b>
5
New_York    75 59 28   0 3 8 7 3
Baltimore   71 63 28   3 0 2 7 7
Boston      69 66 27   8 2 0 0 3
Toronto     63 72 27   7 7 0 0 3
Detroit     49 86 27   3 7 3 3 0
</pre></blockquote>

You may assume that <em>N</em> ≥ 1 and that the input files
are in the specified format and internally consistent.
Note that a team's number of remaining games
does not necessarily equal the sum of the remaining games against teams in its division
because a team may play opponents outside its division.

<p>
<strong>Output format.</strong>
&nbsp;
Use the following <tt>main()</tt> function, which reads in a sports division
from an input file and prints out whether each team
is mathematically eliminated and a certificate of elimination for
each team that is eliminated:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>public static void main(String[] args) {
    BaseballElimination division = new BaseballElimination(args[0]);
    for (String team : division.teams()) {
        if (division.isEliminated(team)) {
            StdOut.print(team + " is eliminated by the subset R = { ");
            for (String t : division.certificateOfElimination(team)) {
                StdOut.print(t + " ");
            }
            StdOut.println("}");
        }
        else {
            StdOut.println(team + " is not eliminated");
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

Below is the desired output:

<p>
</p><blockquote><pre>% <b>java BaseballElimination teams4.txt</b>
Atlanta is not eliminated
Philadelphia is eliminated by the subset R = { Atlanta New_York }
New_York is not eliminated
Montreal is eliminated by the subset R = { Atlanta }

% <b>java BaseballElimination teams5.txt</b>
New_York is not eliminated
Baltimore is not eliminated
Boston is not eliminated
Toronto is not eliminated
Detroit is eliminated by the subset R = { New_York Baltimore Boston Toronto }

</pre></blockquote>

&nbsp;

Analyze the worst-case memory usage and running time of your algorithm.

</p><ul>

<p></p><li> What is the order of growth of the amount of memory (in the worst case)
that your program uses to determine whether <em>one</em> team is eliminated?
In particular, how many vertices and edges are in the flow network
as a function of the number of teams <em>N</em>?

<p></p></li><li> What is the order of growth of the running time (in the worst case)
of your program to determine whether <em>one</em> team is eliminated
as a function of the number of teams <em>N</em>?
In your calculation, assume that the order of growth of the running time 
(in the worst case) to compute a maxflow in a network
